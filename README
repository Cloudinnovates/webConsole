Real time web console with node.js


This script is obsolete (only works with old versions of node.js). It uses one old library for websokets.
IMHO is not a good idea try to fix it (feel free to do it if you want :) ). Maybe it's better to use socket.io

Anyway you can see a worrking example of the script at youtube:

I've done another version of this script.

This version is not the same. It use Symfony's Process component to run the commands and sends the output to the node.js server. 
It uses socket.io
