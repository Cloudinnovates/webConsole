Real time web console with node.js


This script is obsolete (only works with old versions of node.js). It uses one old library for websokets.
IMHO is not a good idea try to fix it (feel free to do it if you want :) ). Maybe it's better to use socket.io

Anyway you can see a worrking example of the script at youtube:
